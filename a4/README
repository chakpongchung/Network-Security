Hello Dr.Wahab,

The answer for q1 is in "q1.ods", I created a excel sheet for the Euclid's algorithm for the SID.

The answer for q2 is in "q2".

Assignment #4
Due Midnight, Thursday Nov. 19, 2015
 
Q1: Euclid’s Algorithm
 
Each of you is assigned two 6-digits distinct primes p & q.
File  RandomPrimes  contain  your assigned  p & q values.
 
1.  Compute n = p.q & Ø(n) = (p-1)(q-1). 
2.  Use e =65537
4.  Use Euclid’s Algorithm to compute d, the exponentiative inverse of e     i.e., e.d = 1 mod Ø(n).
5.  Compute SID, the signed value of your ODU 8-digits  ID using your computed private key  <d,n>.

Q2:  Zero Knowledge Proof

The Graph isomorphism problem is an example of Zero Knowledge Proof Systems.
The following is Dr. Wahab’s  public key graphs. 
Find his private key (i.,e., the mapping between the two graphs).

Submission:
 
·        tar your files:  README and all relevant files of your solutions to  Q1 and Q2.
in a file called <login>.tar  where  login is your unix login name.
 
·        Use Diffie-Hellman with  p = 104729  and g = 104723 to generate a shared secret  DHS  between you and cs772.
File  RandomPrimes  contain  the  random secrets.
 
·        Use DES to encrypt file <login>.tar  using  DHS  and save the result in <login>_Tar.base64
·        Use HMAC to authenticate  file <login>.tar  using DHS  and save the result in <login>_Tar.hmac
·        tar  cf <login>-SID.tar  <login>_Tar.base64  <login>_Tar.hmac
·        Submit    <login>-SID.tar    to  cs772   under Assignment  #4.
·        To test your submission:
cd  /home/cs772/public_html/fall15/assignments/a4/gradingScripts 
and follow the instructions in README_grade
