The great 20th century scientist Albert Einstein developed a theory called Special Relativity. 
The ideas of Special Relativity are very hard to imagine because they aren't about what we experience in everyday life,but scientists have confirmed them. This theory says that space and time are really aspects of the same thing-space-time. 
There's a speed limit of 300,000 kilometers-per second (or 186,000 miles per second) for anything that travels through space-time, and light always travels the speed limit through empty space.
Special Relativity also says that a surprising thing happens when you move through space-time, especially when your speed relative to other objects is close to the speed of light. Time goes slower for you than for the people you left behind. 
You won't notice this effect until you return to those stationary people.
Say you were 21 years old when you left Earth in a spacecraft traveling at about 99.5% of the speed of light (which is much faster than we can achieve now), and celebrated only five birthdays during your space voyage. When you get home at the age of 26, you would find that all your classmates were 71 years old, retired, and enjoying their grandchildren! Because time passed more slowly for you, you will have experienced only five years of life, while your classmates will have experienced a full 50 years. 
Do you think that time travel is possible??
