In order to generate all the files for submission, change the part
":Y:->:C:" and ":C:->:Y:" in 'y1.sh', 'c1.sh' and 'y2.sh'

Then run in the terminal:
# bash y1.sh
# bash c1.sh(only useful for decrypting the message from others)
# bash y2.sh

Then you will see 'Y_C.tar'























Following is the assignment description

CS 772
Assignment #3
Due Midnight, Thursday Nov 5, 2015

Message Digest   has many applications among which are:  Encryption & Message Authentication.
 
In this assignments, let:
Y :   You
C :  Classmate in this course
G :  Grader (cs772)
 
Encryption: XOR  the plain message with a Pad  (using fxorEncDecBase64.py  ).
Pad Generation: MD4 is used for generating a pad (using  genPad.sh ).
Message Authentication: HMAC/MD4 (using openssl ).
 
Y:
 
1.     Edit a message M1 of at least 20 bytes to send C
2.     Use the password  P1=“:Y:->:C:” to generate a onetime pad to
encrypt  M1 and save it  in  file: M1.base64
3.     Use HMAC to authenticate M1  with P1.
Use Y’s  private key to sign the HMAC and  save it in a file: M1Sig.base64.
4.     Email  C  the two files  M1.base64 & M1Sig.base64.
 
C:
 
1.     Decrypt M.base64 and read M1.
2.     Verify the signature  and Authenticate M1Sig.base64 
3.     Edit a reply M2 that have of at least 20 new byes followed by the received plain message M1.
4.     Use  the password P2= “:C:->:Y:”  to  generate a onetime pad to
eencrypt M2  and save it  in  file: M2.base64
5.     Use HMAC to authenticate M2  with P2.
Use C’s  private key to sign the HMAC and  save it in a file: M2Sig.base64.
6.     Email  Y  the two files  M2.base64 & M2Sig.base64.
 
Y:   
 
1.     Decrypt M2.base64 and read M2.
2.     Verify the signature  and Authenticate M2Sig.base64 
3.     Edit a summary message M3 that have of at least 20 new byes
followed by the received plain message M2.
4.     Use  the password  P3=“:Y:->:G:”  to  generate a onetime pad  to
encrypt M3  and save it  in  file: M3Enc.base64
5.     Use HMAC to authenticate  M3  with P3.
Use Y’s  private key to sign the HMAC and  save it in a file: M3Sig.base64.
 
6.  tar -cf Y_C.tar  README  M1.base64  M1Sig.base64    M2.base64  M2Sig.base64    M3.base64  M3Sig.base64
 
6.     Submit    Y_C.tar to cs772   under Assignment  #3.
